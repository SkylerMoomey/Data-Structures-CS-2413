Project 1 is a command line program that allows the user to read in drilling data in an 18 column comma-separated format. 
The program runs various error checking steps and allows the user to sort based on a given column in the data or search for
a user-specified query. The data is stored using a dynamically resizable array created by myself and is sorted using a quicksort written 
by me. Additionally, I have implemented and altered both binarySearch and linearSearch functions to return all instances of a data
key found, not just the first.
